This agile principle works well with it. As we have seen, the Agile principle emphasizes interaction and people rather than processes and tools. Exercising this principle allows team members to delve deep into each other's tasks and questions and give suggestions. This drives interaction among the team and aids in increasing morale and improves work satisfaction.\nIn addition, the fact that agile is an iterative way of running a project allows teams to start in a clean slate after every iteration. Why is this beneficial? Most often than not, teams find it hard for them to find a definite way of doing things and it requires a lot of trial and error and collection of feedback from stakeholders and clients before finding the right fit. This agile principle allows teams to do just that by making a hypothesis, trying it out in an iteration, and evaluating if the result coincides with the hypothesis at the end of the sprint iteration. If it does, then the team has found the right solution, otherwise, they could move on to another hypothesis. This flexibility allows the team to make better decisions.\nAs we can see, the above shows some of the ways how agile principles bring about better team workflow in delivering results by allowing team involvement and allowing the team to fail and try again. This has also revamped the way projects are run in contrast to the past where the waterfall principle (following a rigid timeline, fixed processes, and tool) was practiced.","position":{"start":{"line":46,"column":1,"offset":4064},"end":{"line":49,"column":371,"offset":5721},"indent":[1,1,1]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":46,"column":1,"offset":4064},"end":{"line":49,"column":371,"offset":5721},"indent":[1,1,1]}},{"type":"heading","depth":2,"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Understand the purpose of Scrum ceremonies","position":{"start":{"line":51,"column":4,"offset":5728},"end":{"line":51,"column":46,"offset":5770},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":51,"column":1,"offset":5725},"end":{"line":51,"column":46,"offset":5770},"indent":[]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"Lastly, I would like to describe the ceremonies that the Scrum team does to execute the agile principles explained in the second part of the article above and also explain the purpose behind them.","position":{"start":{"line":53,"column":1,"offset":5774},"end":{"line":53,"column":197,"offset":5970},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":53,"column":1,"offset":5774},"end":{"line":53,"column":197,"offset":5970},"indent":[]}},{"type":"heading","depth":3,"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Sprint planning (First day of the sprint)","position":{"start":{"line":55,"column":5,"offset":5978},"end":{"line":55,"column":46,"offset":6019},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":55,"column":1,"offset":5974},"end":{"line":55,"column":46,"offset":6019},"indent":[]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"It is a planning session whereby the team comes together to ","position":{"start":{"line":57,"column":1,"offset":6023},"end":{"line":57,"column":61,"offset":6083},"indent":[]}},{"type":"strong","children":[{"type":"text","value":"understand the sprint goal and plan their work allocation.","position":{"start":{"line":57,"column":63,"offset":6085},"end":{"line":57,"column":121,"offset":6143},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":57,"column":61,"offset":6083},"end":{"line":57,"column":123,"offset":6145},"indent":[]}},{"type":"text","value":"\nThe purpose is to serve as a collaboration session between the Product Owner and the team on the best way to achieve the sprint goal.

This agile principle works well with it. As we have seen, the Agile principle emphasizes interaction and people rather than processes and tools. Exercising this principle allows team members to delve deep into each other's tasks and questions and give suggestions. This drives interaction among the team and aids in increasing morale and improves work satisfaction.\\nIn addition, the fact that agile is an iterative way of running a project allows teams to start in a clean slate after every iteration. Why is this beneficial? Most often than not, teams find it hard for them to find a definite way of doing things and it requires a lot of trial and error and collection of feedback from stakeholders and clients before finding the right fit. This agile principle allows teams to do just that by making a hypothesis, trying it out in an iteration, and evaluating if the result coincides with the hypothesis at the end of the sprint iteration. If it does, then the team has found the right solution, otherwise, they could move on to another hypothesis. This flexibility allows the team to make better decisions.\\nAs we can see, the above shows some of the ways how agile principles bring about better team workflow in delivering results by allowing team involvement and allowing the team to fail and try again.

If I were to list them all out, this article would become a very long one. To not bore my readers, I shall only discuss one of them which I feel deserves an article on its own. Even if you are not a software engineer, I believe that this article is `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`relevant to anyone who finds himself/herself working in or with a scrum team.`}</strong>{`\nI know that many newcomers to the field of software engineering are always very focused on mastering the technical tools (learning the tech stack etc)that would enable them to contribute to the team. While I agree that this is critical in enabling an individual to get up to speed and make contributions to the team (contributing to the code base etc), there is another learning point that is often neglected but equally important. That is, `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`understanding the key principles of Scrum`}</strong>{` which is a methodology practiced by many software engineering teams. It is important to understand why a team has to practice Scrum as well as how to tap on the benefits of Scrum in becoming a more effective team player. This is the least talked about. Many times, at least for my past 2 internships, nobody in my team has ever explained to me why the Scrum methodology is practiced. Hence, I found myself blindly adhering to the scrum ceremonies without truly understanding what the purpose was.\nI am sure that I am not the only one. Hence, I hope my article will help my readers to understand it better, and hopefully, we can all be better contributors to whatever projects we are working on.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`Threads that make up the fabric of a Software Scrum team (team structure)`}</h3>\n    <p>{`The first step to understanding Scrum is to recognize the roles and responsibilities of each individual in the scrum team. A software scrum team is made up of `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`Product Owner, core development team`}</strong>{`, and some times a Scrum master (in more mature agile teams, a scrum master may focus their efforts more towards external functions and stakeholders.). Let me try to break down the different roles above.\n`}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`Product Owner`}</strong>{`: Create a vision for the product, lead in prioritization product features to be developed, creating requirements\n`}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`Scrum Master`}</strong>{`: Facilitate Scrum ceremonies and ensure that teams adhere to key Scrum principles, Offer one-on-one coaching to motivate team members\n`}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`Core Development Team`}</strong>{`: Researching, designing and implement the product to fruition\nSo what about the role of project manager? Well, the usual responsibilities of a PM are then split into either the PO, the scrum master, or the team. Usually, the budget is owned by the PO, managing risk is co-own by the entire team depending on the types of risk. Impediments are tracked and supported by the scrum master.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`See the beauty of Scrum and the agile concept behind it`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Now, let's delve into the realms of the `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`Agile principle`}</strong>{` and `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`SCRUM methodology`}</strong>{`.\n`}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`Agile is a mindset`}</strong>{`\ndescribed by the following `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`four values:`}</strong>{`\nIndividuals and Interactions `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`over`}</strong>{` Processes and tools\nWorking software `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`over`}</strong>{` Comprehensive Documentation\nResponding to Changes `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`over`}</strong>{` following a plan\nCustomer collaboration `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`over`}</strong>{` Contract Negotiation`}</p>\n    <p>{`Defined by `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`12 principles`}</strong>{` below:\nSatisfy the customer\nwelcome change\ndeliver frequently\nwork together\ntrust and support\nface to face conversation\nworking software\nsustainable development\ncontinuous attention\nmaintain simplicity\nself-organizing teams\nReflect and adjust`}</p>\n    <p>{`Agile is manifested through an unlimited number of practices. In our case Scrum.\nScrum is an agile framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products. Scrum embodies a set of practices termed ceremonies.\nIn summary, the Scrum team's project is managed in small iterations to continuously improve the product and the team. This model encourages teams to `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`experiment and find ways that work best`}</strong>{` for them and achieve the team's goals more efficiently.`}</p>\n    <hr></hr>\n    <p>{`Why is it beautiful?\nMany millennials like myself aspire to be in a workplace that is empowering and gives us a voice to speak up rather than following instructions rigidly. This agile principle works well with it. As we have seen, the Agile principle emphasizes interaction and people rather than processes and tools. Exercising this principle allows team members to delve deep into each other's tasks and questions and give suggestions. This drives interaction among the team and aids in increasing morale and improves work satisfaction.\nIn addition, the fact that agile is an iterative way of running a project allows teams to start in a clean slate after every iteration. Why is this beneficial? Most often than not, teams find it hard for them to find a definite way of doing things and it requires a lot of trial and error and collection of feedback from stakeholders and clients before finding the right fit. This agile principle allows teams to do just that by making a hypothesis, trying it out in an iteration, and evaluating if the result coincides with the hypothesis at the end of the sprint iteration. If it does, then the team has found the right solution, otherwise, they could move on to another hypothesis. This flexibility allows the team to make better decisions.\nAs we can see, the above shows some of the ways how agile principles bring about better team workflow in delivering results by allowing team involvement and allowing the team to fail and try again. This has also revamped the way projects are run in contrast to the past where the waterfall principle (following a rigid timeline, fixed processes, and tool) was practiced.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Understand the purpose of Scrum ceremonies`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Lastly, I would like to describe the ceremonies that the Scrum team does to execute the agile principles explained in the second part of the article above and also explain the purpose behind them.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`Sprint planning (First day of the sprint)`}</h3>\n    <p>{`It is a planning session whereby the team comes together to `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`understand the sprint goal and plan their work allocation.`}</strong>{`\nThe purpose is to serve as a collaboration session between the Product Owner and the team on the best way to achieve the sprint goal.
